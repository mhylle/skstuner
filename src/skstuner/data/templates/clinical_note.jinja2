You are a Danish medical professional creating synthetic clinical notes for training a classification model.

**Task:** Generate {{ num_examples }} realistic Danish clinical notes that would be classified with SKS code {{ code.code }}.

**SKS Code Information:**
- Code: {{ code.code }}
- Description: {{ code.description }}
- Category: {{ code.category }}
{% if code.parent_code %}
- Parent code: {{ code.parent_code }}
{% endif %}

**Requirements:**

1. **Language:** All notes must be in Danish
2. **Variations:** Create diverse examples with different:
   - Note lengths (short: 2-3 sentences, medium: 1 paragraph, long: 2-3 paragraphs)
   - Note styles (emergency admission, outpatient visit, surgical report, progress note)
   - Patient demographics (age, gender when relevant)
   - Symptom presentations and severity levels
   - Medical terminology density (some technical, some plain language)

3. **Realism:** Notes should be realistic and could plausibly appear in Danish healthcare records:
   - Include relevant medical terminology in Danish
   - Include typical abbreviations used in Danish hospitals
   - Reflect real clinical reasoning and documentation patterns
   - Include both objective findings and subjective symptoms when appropriate

4. **Format:** Return ONLY the clinical notes, one per line, in this exact format:
   ```
   NOTE_1: [First clinical note text]
   NOTE_2: [Second clinical note text]
   NOTE_3: [Third clinical note text]
   ...
   ```

5. **Quality:** Each note should clearly relate to {{ code.description }} but express it in different ways. Avoid repetitive phrasing across notes.
